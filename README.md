# Luna Port Scanner
IPv6 and IPv4 port scanner

System requirements: Windows 10/11 64bit


What’s New in Luna Port Scanner 2.0

    Async Engine: Now powered by asyncio for massively faster, concurrent scans.

    Port Range & List Support: Scan single ports, comma-separated lists, or ranges (e.g., 22,80,8000-8100).

    Command-Line Interface: Use command-line arguments for scripting and automation, not just interactive prompts.

    TCP & UDP, Simultaneously: Scan TCP, UDP, or both in parallel.

    IPv4/IPv6 Enhanced: Explicitly scans both IPv4 and IPv6 as available, with per-family reporting.

    Concurrency Control: Limit simultaneous connections to suit your environment and avoid “too many open files” errors.

    Colored Terminal Output: Results and warnings are color-coded for readability (thanks to colorama).

    Improved Error Handling: Graceful handling of invalid inputs, unresolved domains, and interruptions.

    Custom UDP Diagnostics: Advanced UDP checks can detect more open or filtered states.

    Modular & Extensible: Clean, modular design makes future feature additions easier.

Upgrade now for a faster, smarter, and more flexible port scanner experience.
